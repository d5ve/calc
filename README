Code from https://metacpan.org/pod/Term::ReadLine

To get readline working properly, I installed Term::ReadLine::GNU following the
instructions from
http://blogs.perl.org/users/aristotle/2013/07/easy-osx-termreadlinegnu.html

Readline is already installed, but the Makefile doesn't pick it up, so make
homebrew install some temporary symlinks.

dave> brew install readline
dave> brew link --force readline
dave> sudo su -
root> cpan Term::ReadLine::GNU
root> exit
dave> brew unlink readline
